# About

Neo4j Versioner Core has been developed by [Alberto D'Este](https://github.com/albertodeste) and [Marco Falcier](https://github.com/mfalcier).

## Entity-State (ES) Data Model

The current data model uses two kind of nodes: the Entity nodes, created by the user through a given Label and the `State` nodes, managed by the Graph Versioner.
The `State` node can be seen as the set of mutable properties which regards the Entity, which possesses only immutable properties.
There are 4 different relationships:
* `(:Entity)-[:CURRENT {date: localdatetime('1988-10-27T02:46:40')}]-(:State)`, representing the current Entity `State`;
* `(:Entity)-[:HAS_STATE {startDate: localdatetime('1988-10-27T00:00:00'), endDate: localdatetime('1988-10-27T02:46:40')}]-(State)`, representing an Entity `State`, it will have an endDate only if the `State` node is not the current one;
* `(newerState:State)-[:PREVIOUS {date: localdatetime('1988-10-27T00:00:00')}]->(older:State)`, representing the previous `State` of the indexed one.
* `(rollbackedState:State)-[:ROLLBACK]->(older:State)`, representing that one `State` has been rolled back to a previous one.

This is how the data model looks like:

## Entity-State-R (ESR) Data Model

From version 2.0.0 you can now also version relationships: when an Entity node is created, also its own `R` node is created. So from the previous model, you can also add this new relationship:
* `(:Entity {number: 1})<-[:FOR]-(:R)<-[:CUSTOM_RELATIONSHIP]-(:State)<-[:HAS_STATE]-(:Entity {number: 2})`, representing that an Entity is related to its own `R` node.

The `R` node is the Entity's access point for its own incoming relationships; this way, we can also keep track of relationships verse.
Remember, only relationships managed with this tool will be versioned.

This is how the data model looks like:

# Procedures Reference

Neo4j procedure documentation can also be found using `CALL dbms.procedures()`.

## How to call Core Versioner Procedures on your procedures/functions

If you want to use Neo4j Versioner Core procedures on your procedures/functions you simply create a new instance:

```java
Optional<Init> result = new InitBuilder().withTransaction(transaction).withLog(log).build();
result.ifPresent(a -> a.init("EntityLabel", entityProps, stateProps, additionalLabel, date));
```

### Maven users

Add the following repository and dependency to your `pom.xml` file

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>

    <artifactId>neo4j-versioner-core</artifactId>
    <version>4.2.4</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add the following repository and dependency to your `build.gradle` file

```
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.h-omer:neo4j-versioner-core:4.2.4'

## init

This procedure is used in order to initialize an Entity node, with an initial State. 
If a Map of `State` properties is given, a `State` node will be created, with both `HAS_STATE` and `CURRENT` relationships; otherwise, a `State` node without properties will be created. 
If date is given, `date` and `startDate` will be initialized with that value.

```

## update

This procedure is used to update a status of an existing Entity node. It will create a new `State` node, deleting the previous `CURRENT` relationship, creating a new one to the new created node with the current date (or the optional one, if given); then it updates the last `HAS_STATE` relationship adding the current/given date as the `endDate` and creating a new `HAS_STATE` relationship with `startDate` as the current/given date. It will also create a new relationship between the new and the last `State` called `PREVIOUS`, with the old date as a property.
If the Entity node has no `State`, it will create a new `State` node, with both `HAS_STATE` and `CURRENT` relationships.
If no properties are passed, a new `State` node will be created, without properties.
If a custom relationship exists between the current `State` and a `R` node, that relationship is kept on the updated `State`.

It will also create a new relationship between the new and the last `State` called `PREVIOUS`, with the old date as a property.
If the Entity node has no `State`, it will create a new `State` node, with both `HAS_STATE` and `CURRENT` relationships. 
If no properties are passed, a copy of the `CURRENT` node will be created as the new `State`.
